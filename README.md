# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
This project focuses on gathering, analyzing, and correlating data related to bike stations in Vancouver. The primary objectives include retrieving bike station information using the CityBike API, exploring Points of Interest (POI) with Yelp and Foursquare APIs, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and building a predictive model to investigate the correlation between the number of bikes in use and the surrounding POI.

## Process
1. API Calls:
Utilized the CityBike API to obtain comprehensive data on bike stations in Vancouver.
Invoked Yelp and Foursquare APIs to gather information about Points of Interest in the vicinity.

2. Data Exploration:
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the collected data to unveil insights and patterns.

3. Correlation Modeling:
Built a predictive model to investigate potential correlations between the number of bikes in use at a station and the surrounding Points of Interest.

## Project Highlights:

1. Data Sources:
CityBike API for bike station details.
Yelp and Foursquare APIs for Points of Interest information.

2. Analytical Approach:
Explored the dataset using statistical and visual analysis techniques.
Implemented machine learning techniques to quantify relationships between variables.

3. Insights and Findings:
Uncovered patterns and correlations within the data.
Provided insights into how the availability of bikes may be influenced by the surrounding points of interest.

## Results
Model Performance:
Despite thorough exploration and analysis, the predictive model did not yield a significant correlation between the number of bikes in use and the surrounding Points of Interest. The R-squared value, a metric representing the goodness of fit, was found to be very low.
