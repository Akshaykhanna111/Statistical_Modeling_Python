# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
This project focuses on gathering, analyzing, and correlating data related to bike stations in Vancouver. The primary objectives include retrieving bike station information using the CityBike API, exploring Points of Interest (POI) with Yelp and Foursquare APIs, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and building a predictive model to investigate the correlation between the number of bikes in use and the surrounding POI.

## Process
1. API Calls:
Utilized the CityBike API to obtain comprehensive data on bike stations in Vancouver.
Invoked Yelp and Foursquare APIs to gather information about Points of Interest in the vicinity.

2. Data Exploration:
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the collected data to unveil insights and patterns.

3. Correlation Modeling:
Built a predictive model to investigate potential correlations between the number of bikes in use at a station and the surrounding Points of Interest.
